# Feature: Social Share Buttons

**Status:** Initial implementation
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-03
**Owner:** Frontend + Backend
**Issue:** [#569](https://github.com/ilv78/Art-World-Hub/issues/569)

## Summary

Per-item share buttons on artwork, blog post, exhibition, and artist profile pages. Hybrid UX: on mobile (Web Share API available) a single "Share" button opens the OS share sheet; on desktop a row of per-platform buttons + Copy link. Every click is recorded server-side for our own analytics.

## Decisions

### Platform list (Phase 1 analysis)

| Platform | Desktop button | Mobile (OS sheet) | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Facebook | Yes | Yes (via OS sheet) | `sharer.php` — works |
| LinkedIn | Yes | Yes | `share-offsite` — works |
| Pinterest | Yes | Yes | `pin/create/button` — fits visual art |
| X (Twitter) | Yes | Yes | `intent/tweet` — works on twitter.com and x.com |
| Bluesky | Yes | Yes | `bsky.app/intent/compose` — works web + iOS |
| Instagram | **No** | Yes (via OS sheet only) | Instagram has no public web share intent — desktop button would be a dead-end. On mobile the OS share sheet routes to the IG app. |
| Copy link | Yes | (via OS sheet) | Always-works fallback |

### Public share counts (e.g. "shared 42 times on Facebook")

Dropped. Public count APIs were removed by Facebook (2018), LinkedIn (2017), and never existed for X/Bluesky/Instagram. Pinterest still has one but it's unreliable. Showing "0" or "—" on five of six platforms degrades the UI; we'd rather track our own counts.

### Self-tracked analytics

In scope. Every click on a share button POSTs to `/api/share-events` with `{itemType, itemId, platform, userAgentClass}`. Stored in `share_events` table for admin reporting. Rate-limited at **6 req/min/IP** because a normal user shares a handful of times in a session at most; anything higher is botting the analytics.

### UTM tagging

Outbound URLs are tagged with `?utm_source=<platform>&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=<itemType>`. Incoming `utm_*` params on the page URL are stripped before re-tagging so a user re-sharing a link they arrived at via a previous share doesn't produce duplicate UTMs.

## Architecture

### Server

- **Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`): `share_events` table — `id`, `item_type`, `item_id`, `platform`, `user_id` (nullable — anonymous shares allowed), `user_agent_class`, `created_at`. Three indexes: `(item_type, item_id)`, `created_at`, `platform`.
- **Storage** (`server/storage.ts`):
  - `recordShareEvent(event)` — append-only insert
  - `getShareEventStats({ sinceDays })` — aggregates: totals by platform, top 20 items
- **Routes** (`server/routes.ts`):
  - `POST /api/share-events` — public, Zod-validated, 6/min/IP rate limit
  - `GET /api/admin/share-events/stats?days=N` — admin-only, defaults to 30 days, clamped 1–365
- **Meta tags** (`server/meta.ts`):
  - New `/curator-gallery/:id` branch — OG/Twitter tags + `ExhibitionEvent` JSON-LD with `VirtualLocation`
  - New `?artwork=<slug>` short-circuit — when any URL carries this query param, emit artwork-specific OG and set canonical/og:url to `/artworks/<slug>` so SEO + FB OG dedup treat the detail page as authoritative even when the shared URL is e.g. `/store?artwork=foo`
  - Refactored existing `/artworks/:slug` branch to share `buildArtworkMetaFrom()` with the query-param flow (eliminated ~50 lines of duplication)
  - **`ogImage` for the four item branches points at `/api/og/<type>/<id>.jpg?v=<8charHash>`** (#577) — the dynamic branded card endpoint. Hash is computed over `title|subtitle|sourceImageUrl` so an item edit busts FB/X external cache. Static routes (`/`, `/store`, `/gallery`, etc.) keep `DEFAULT_OG_IMAGE` — only items shared via the in-app share button get the branded card.
- **Branded OG card pipeline** (`server/lib/og-card.ts`, `server/routes/og-cards.ts`) — see #577:
  - 1200×630 JPEG composed via sharp + SVG overlay (Playfair Display Bold title, Inter Regular subtitle, full-width brand-orange divider near the bottom, V-diamond logo + `vernis9.art` wordmark beneath the divider — mirrors the in-app `<Vernis9Logo>`)
  - Source image: blurred 20px + brightness modulated to 0.85; gradient darken on top for title legibility. When no source asset exists (artist with no avatar, artwork hosted on an external URL we won't fetch), the background uses a brand-orange radial-glow + faint diagonal accent so the card looks intentional rather than "image failed"
  - On-disk cache at `uploads/og-cards/<type>-<id>.jpg`; freshness check compares cache file mtime to source-image mtime (works without table-level `updatedAt`)
  - Sets `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` on every response — overrides helmet's `same-origin` default which otherwise blocks Facebook / X / LinkedIn / Telegram from embedding the image cross-origin
  - Fallback chain: item not found / unknown type / sharp error → `client/public/og-default.png` with short TTL
  - Brand fonts bundled in `assets/fonts/` (SIL OFL); installed system-wide in the Docker image via `fontconfig`
- **OG meta hardening** (`client/index.html`, `server/meta.ts`):
  - Added `og:image:width` / `og:image:height` (1200×630, applies to both branded card and `og-default.png`) + `og:image:alt` / `twitter:image:alt`. FB / Telegram skip images on cold scrapes when dimensions are missing
  - `escapeHtml` in `server/meta.ts` now collapses whitespace (`\s+` → ` `) before HTML-escaping. Source values like artist bios contain literal newlines; unescaped, they break HTML attribute parsing in stricter consumers (FB bails on a meta tag whose `content="..."` value spans multiple physical lines and never reaches `og:image`)
- **Copy link share** (`client/src/components/share-buttons.tsx`): now UTM-tags the copied URL via `withUtm(url, "copy", itemType)` like the platform buttons do. Gives analytics a "copy" channel AND varies the URL string per share, which bypasses per-URL preview caches in apps like Telegram that otherwise lock onto a single stale preview for a bare URL

### Client

- **Pure helpers** (`shared/share-urls.ts`): `withUtm`, `buildShareUrl`, `buildNativeShareData`. No DOM, no fetch — testable from server-side test suite.
- **Client wrapper** (`client/src/lib/share-urls.ts`): re-exports the pure helpers + adds `postShareEvent` (fires the analytics POST with `keepalive: true` so it survives navigation during a popup share).
- **Component** (`client/src/components/share-buttons.tsx`):
  - Feature-detects `navigator.share` *and* mobile UA class (we don't show the native button on desktop browsers that happen to expose `navigator.share`)
  - Inline brand SVGs for FB/LinkedIn/Pinterest/X/Bluesky (kept tiny, single-color)
  - Copy link uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText` + toast + inline checkmark feedback
- **Page integrations**: `artwork-detail` (also gained an `Add to Cart` button so the page action set matches the modal), `blog-post`, `curator-gallery` (non-immersive header only — doesn't intrude on 3D mode), `artist-profile`.
- **Modal integration** (`client/src/components/artwork-detail-dialog.tsx`): share buttons live under the Add-to-Cart action. The modal builds a per-context share URL of the form `<currentPath>?artwork=<slug>` (vs. the page's plain canonical URL) so recipients see the same modal-over-context UX as the sender.
- **Auto-open hook** (`client/src/hooks/use-modal-from-query.ts`): wired into every parent page that mounts the dialog (home, store, gallery, artist profile, curator gallery). When the URL carries `?artwork=<slug>`, the hook waits for the artworks list to load, finds the matching artwork by slug, and opens the modal. Closing the modal strips the param via `history.replaceState` so a refresh doesn't reopen it. Tracks "last applied slug" with a ref so the close-cleanup doesn't race the open-effect on initial render.
- **Title-click hijack**: artwork titles in `<ArtworkCard>` (store/gallery/curator-gallery) and on artist portfolio cards now open the modal on click. The `<a href="/artworks/<slug>">` is kept for SEO crawlability (no JS); user clicks call `e.preventDefault()` and trigger `onViewDetails`.
- **Artist profile dialog mount**: moved the `<ArtworkDetailDialog>` from inside the portfolio `TabsContent` to the page root so it's rendered regardless of active tab. When `?artwork=<slug>` is present in the URL, the active tab also defaults to `portfolio` so the modal opens over a meaningful context.

### Admin

New "Shares" tab in `/admin` with two cards:
1. **Shares by platform** — totals over the last 30 days
2. **Top shared items** — top 20 items by share count

Currently shows `itemType` + `itemId` + count. Future iteration could resolve item names by joining against the source tables; deferred to keep the storage query simple.

## Out of scope (deferred)

- **Branded OG card images (logo + item visual + title)** — opened as [#577](https://github.com/ilv78/Art-World-Hub/issues/577). Today's `og:image` for each item is the raw asset (artwork, cover, hero, avatar); composing a branded preview is its own design discussion.
- **Auctions detail share** — no detail page exists; covered by [#509](https://github.com/ilv78/Art-World-Hub/issues/509).
- **Site-wide analytics tool (Plausible/PostHog/etc.)** — bigger decision (privacy banner, GDPR, tool choice); separate issue.
- **Item-name resolution in admin top-N view** — small future iteration.
- **Public "shared N times" display on item pages** — possible later; data is already there.
